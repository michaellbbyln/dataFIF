#Horrible experience of Redmi 6pro - Readon to know more##,"Please don't buy!!

Horrible phone from Xiaomi!!

The phone is just for people who like showing off the new iPhone notch design. The phone uses an outdated processor and lags terrible in term of performance. When we use more than 4apps at a time, the phone will get hanged and you will be forced to restart the phone. Watching videos for more than 20mins the phone gets extrmely heated and you will have to put it to stanby fir a while before resarting the use of the phone. Very bad multi-tasking. The build quality is okay, but not as good as other budget phone. A flat drop on the front screen side if hit hardly will crack the screen. The front camera is extremely poor and has been downgraded and doesn't produce even a decent quality picture. Selfie lovers, please don't even buy this phone you will get a heart ache after looking at your pix. The rear camera picture quality is average and is very unlike of xiaomi.

On the other side, the basic things like the output from the speaker phone and and the earphone are extremely poor and distorted...

The only con is a decent screen, however that is contributed by low quality video while played in amazon or netflix..

Had complained to Amazon on the above low quality issues, unfortunately Amazon is not willing to listen, they are saying technically the phone is working and hence it can't taken back.. Unfortunately, in this case Amazon has put its sellers over it buyers who are their bread and butter. Hope Amazon listens to my complaint here and takes measures to improve their service... Just to put things into perspective, an average 6-7k phone is sold at an extremely abnoxiously at a high price of 11k. You can find many better phone at this high price. Please stop buying this phone. Thanks for reading. Extremely sadened on buying this phone...",10 people found this helpful

Not worth the money paid. Worst camera & screen size,Camera is too worst considering price of the phone. Front camera worst than other ordinary mobiles. Processor not that much fast than other 2 ghz speed mobiles of redmi. Notch is only for namesake and size sake. It's a big let down. Bought this phone considering notch option. But redmi disappointed here. Is redmi started thinking India as dump yard. Redmi Y2 is better option than this.,5 people found this helpful
